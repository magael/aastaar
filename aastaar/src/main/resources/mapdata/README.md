Using Nathan Sturtevant's Moving AI Lab 2D pathfinding benchmark game maps.

The folder <code>sc1-map</code> contains maps based on the game Starcraft 1 and <code>wc3maps512-map</code> contains Warcraft 3 maps.

The Warcraft 3 maps had some cosmetic changes made to the edges of the map.

The WC3 maps contain shallow water, which effects the shortest path and it's cost.
